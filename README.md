# Heterogeneous-Ensemble-Classifier-Creation-Using-Majority-Rule-Approach

This .Rmd is set to train an ensemble classifier using the BreastCancer dataset.
The classifiers used were:
Support Vector Machine,
Naive Bayes,
Neural network,
Decision Trees,
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis,
and Regularised Discriminant Analysis. 

Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used on the decision trees to ensure consistency in results.
